### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

**TITLE: Real-time Collaborative Document Editor**

This is a real-time collaborative document editor built using Socket.io, Node.js, Express.js, and a frontend powered by React, HTML, and CSS. The application enables multiple users to edit a shared document simultaneously, with real-time synchronization of content and formatting.

## **Features**

- Rich text editing with support for bold, italic, and underline formatting.

- Dynamic user-specific cursors and color-coded selections.

- System notifications when users join or leave the document.

- Version history and undo/redo functionality.

- Responsive UI for seamless usage across devices.

## **Project Overview**
This collaborative editor allows multiple users to work on the same document by entering a room name. Each user's edits are reflected in real time for all participants. Users can apply text formatting options using buttons for bold, italic, and underline.

The system sends and receives updates using WebSockets to ensure all changes are synced in milliseconds. Additionally, users joining an existing document room will see the current document state, ensuring a consistent editing experience.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React, CSS

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js

- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io

3.Text formatting changes are synchronized using real-time events.

4.Users can toggle bold, italic, or underline using toolbar buttons.

5.System notifications inform when users join or leave.

## **Future Enhancements**
